CSS stands cascadig style sheets
CSS is used to design or to provide layout for the webpage. CSS is intoduced in 1993 and it's one of the powerful design standard language
CSS can be applied to html elements using three ways:
i. inline CSS: it applies styling to an element using "style" as a attribute
syntax: <element style="">something</element

ii. internal CSS: it applies styling to an element or multiple elements using "style" as a element
<style>
    selector{
        //properties
    }
</style>

selector are used to select an element. 
 1. we can select elements using tagname
 2. we can select elements with same classname using .classname
 3. we can select element with id using #idname

preference: !important> id>class>tag

iii. external css: we can include css in separate file with extension .css and use it in HTML using Link tag

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path to css" />

preference: Inline > Internal > external
it is always better to write external so that html and css will not be mixed

CSS comments are multi lined starts with /* and ends with */


colors:
colors speak the brand. use minimal number od colors to avoid user's complexity
we can assign colors in CSS using
   i. colorname
   ii. rgb(red,green,blue) - each one takes from 0 to 255
   iii. rgba(red,greeen,blue,alpha) -- alpha ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, it represents opacity
   iv. hsl(hue,saturation,lightness) -- 
   hue means degree of colorname
   saturation is % of darkness
   lightness is % of lightness
   v. hsla(hue,saturation,lightness,alpha)--alpha ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, it represents opacity
   vi. hexcode: every color will have a hexadecimal number
